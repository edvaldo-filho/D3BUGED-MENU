2. Assure that BE was deactivated, type and open 'services' on windows menu, search for 'Battleeye service' > right-click > properties > Change Manual To Deactivated
3. Open the game, not in online mode directly ! Need to open GTA V into game menu / at least in History mode ! When opened in steam, the steam request if you want join directly online or in history mode
4. With game loaded in history mode or in game menu > L Alt + Tab (Or R Alt + ESC) > Open the Injector (Xenos) > Select GTA5.exe > Add the DLL file > Inject !
5. Its all good ! On the first time will request some settings and update's on the files cache, basically, choice your language and click on Update cache then go to history mode (If you are in game menu)
